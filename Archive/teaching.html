			<h1>Current Semester</h1>

		<p>This spring (2011), I am a lab TA for <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/psychology/undergrad/courses101.html#psyc260">PSYC 2600: Introduction to Social Psychology</a>.</p>
		
			<h1>Selected Quotes From Teaching Evaluations</h1>
			
			<p>"Rachel was great. I gave her all high marks not just to quickly complete a survey, but because I think she truly deserves all of them. She was an effective teacher, always available, and extremely helpful. Even though I'm sure she had a lot of papers to read, she gave multiple comments and feedback on all of my papers, which really helped me to improve. She also welcomed questions and was attuned to everyone's needs. She was an excellent TA and I definitely learned a lot from her."
			<br>--Research Methods student, Spring 2010</p>
			
			<p>"Rachel is incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter- which is impressive because we have covered a lot of topics! I could also tell that she geniuinely cared about her students learning the subject matter.  Especially because she began to change her teaching styles after some students made suggestions in a mid-year eval.  It is often difficult to try new teaching styles, but Rachel did because she cares!"
			<br>--Child Psychology student, Fall 2010</p>
			
			<p>"Rachel excels in the fact that she is extremely friendly and accommodating to students' needs. Furthermore, Rachel was helpful in other areas beyond lecture material and helped me with an associated project. I feel that this shows Rachel's ability to truly embody what it means to be a teacher."
