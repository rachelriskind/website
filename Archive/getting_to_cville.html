	<!-- how to get here -->
	<div id="content">
		<h1>By plane</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><p>The <a href="http://www.gocho.com/">Charlottesville airport (CHO)</a> is nearby, convenient, often expensive to fly in to, and impossible to get a direct flight to. CHO can be inexpensive if you book far in advance, so it's worth checking out.</p>

			
			<li><p>Richmond, former capital of the confederacy, also has an airport.  A much <a href="http://www.flyrichmond.com/">larger and busier airport (RIC)</a>, in fact.  It's still a small airport in the grand scheme of things.  We recommend this option if you&#8217;re at all price-conscious and were going to rent a car anyway.</p>
				<p>When flying out of Richmond, we generally leave for the airport 3 hours before the flight leaves to allow us about 2 hours to drive there, park, and check in.  This means that if your flight leaves at 6am out of Richmond, you have to leave Charlottesville around 3 or 3:30.  This is a good thing to keep in mind when you make your reservation.
				</p>
				<p>Getting from the airport to Charlottesville is simple: follow the signs out of RIC to I64 West.  Stay on I64 until exit 121, 120, or 118B.  Do not go past 118B or you will find yourself on back country roads dodging woodchucks!  The drive from door-to-door will be about 1 hr and 20 min.</p></li>
			<li><p>Washington D.C. has several airports, only one of which, <a href="http://www.mwaa.com/Dulles/">Dulles (IAD)</a>, is even worth considering flying into if Virginia is your destination.  However, we do not recommend this option unless you plan on finding a $120 flight and (a) taking the metro to the Greyhound station, generally slumming it all the way to Charlottesville or (b) renting a car and driving the 2 hours to Charlottesville.  Seriously, the drive out of D.C. is like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/">Escape from New York</a>.</p></li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>By train</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><p>You actually can get to Charlottesville via <ahref="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a>.  The train station is  conveniently located in the center of town and is even attached to a beer and wings joint. Unfortunately, you really have to live on the East Coast to take advantage of this.</p>

			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h1>By automobile</h1>
		<ol>
			<li><p>Sure, it seems simple: just roll down your windows, pop in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival">Creedence</a> tape, and point your car in the general direction of Virginia, but trust us, there are a lot of roads out there, some of which are better than others.</p>
				<p><em>If you&#8217;re coming from the Northeast:</em> Take I84 to I81 (same road, different name) and follow that all the way to I64 East to Charlottesville.  We hear there is a road called I95 which is "faster" but which goes through New York <em>and</em> Baltimore <em>and</em> Washington, D.C. Think about that: you <em>will</em> hit rush hour traffic in at least one major East Coast city.  Boston to Charlottesville takes about 11 hours.</p>
				<p><em>If you&#8217;re coming from the Midwest:</em> Get on I64 as quickly as possible and ride it to victory.  Enjoy the views, scenery, and mountains along the way, but be sure to take a dependable car.</p>
				<p><em>If you&#8217;re coming from the Southwest:</em> Take I40 from Little Rock through most of Kentucky.  Be sure to stop in Nashville on the way for a sandwich and to check out the Parthenon replica.  Outside of Knoxville, get on I81 North and take that all the way to I64 East.  The Blue Ridge Parkway parallels I81 for quite a while, but be warned: once you get on the parkway, you can&#8217;t get off whenever you&#8217;d like.  Besides, I81 is plenty pretty.  Austin to Charlottesville is a 2-day affair.</p>
