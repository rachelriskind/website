Broadly, I am interested in the psychology of sexual orientation and family life.  How might experiences of family vary as a function of one's sexual orientation, and how might they be similar?  How can psychologists contribute to understanding of these processes and help members of sexual minorities achieve the family relationships they want?  Below, I describe some ongoing lines of research which address these goals.

### Predictors of Parenthood

A series of studies to determine why lesbians and gay men, on average, are less likely than their heterosexual peers to express desires and intentions for parenthood and why heterosexual adults so often express them. Includes collaborations with Charlotte J. Patterson, PhD and Brian A. Nosek, PhD.

### Adolescent Sexual Health

A series of studies of psychology and sexual health among adolescents who identify as lesbian, gay or transgender or who report same-sex attractions or sexual behaviors. Includes collaborations with Charlotte J. Patterson, PhD, Samantha L. Tornello, PhD, and [The Fenway Institute at Fenway Health](http://www.fenwayhealth.org/site/PageServer) in Boston.

### Social Climate

A series of studies to predict psychosocial outcomes from zip code- and state-level indices of social climates for members of sexual minorities. Includes collaborations with Mark L. Hatzenbuehler, PhD, Charlotte J. Patterson, PhD, Karen M. Schmidt, PhD, Samantha L. Tornello, PhD, and David J. Lick.

### Implicit Attitudes

A series of studies of implicit and explicit attitudes towards lesbian and gay people, including internalized stigma among lesbian and gay adults.  Includes collaborations with Brian A. Nosek, PhD, Janice Sabin, PhD, MSW, Erin Westgate, MA, and Charlotte J. Patterson, PhD.
