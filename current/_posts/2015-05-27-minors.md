This list is specific to the minors available at Guilford College. I adapted it from Richard L. Miller’s chapter “Choosing a Minor:  Why, What and When” in [Academic Advising, A Handbook for Advisors and Students, Volume 1](http://teachpsych.org/ebooks/academic-advising-2014-vol1).

As an undergrad, I majored in psychology and minored in history and Spanish.  I also took classes in many of the disciplines on this list:  biology, sociology, political science, women's studies, Latin American studies, music, dance, education, English, and religious studies.  I wish I had taken a computer programming class, because I had to learn to program in grad school for statistics coursework and research.
