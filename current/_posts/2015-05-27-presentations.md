I created this guide to help undergraduates improve the quality of their class presentations.  

### Creating your presentation

Start by thinking about what points you want to make.  What is the flow of your argument?

If you like, you can begin by writing full sentences in bullet points on slides.  However, don't stop there.  Copy and paste these full sentences into the "Notes" section in PowerPoint, then begin to condense the versions on the slides.  You don't want full sentences on your slides, so replace something like "Participants ate M&Ms and then jumped on a trampoline" with a flow chart showing people eating M&Ms, then an arrow, then a trampoline.

Remember that the slides are there to help the audience follow along, not to replace the speaker.  If you have full sentences on your slides, your audience will read instead of listening to you.

It's a good idea to use a plain white background with black font or a plain black background with white font.  Other colors can impede readability because there's not enough contrast, and decorative templates often distract from your message and clash with other images.  Remember that the projector reduces contrast.

Include an outline slide at the beginning of the presentation to let the audience know what topics you will cover.

Use pictures, graphs, and other figures for color and visual interest.  Whenever you can, replace a bullet point of text with a photo.  For example, you could replace "Researchers studied children ages 3-5" with a picture of preschool-age children; just be sure to say the ages aloud.

Avoid special effects, including text that flies across the screen, screen-wipe transitions between slides, and anything that blinks.  The slides should emphasize your message, not your ability to experiment with PowerPoint options.

For readability, use font no smaller than 28-pt.  If your text doesn't fit on a single slide with 28-pt font, that's a good sign that you are trying to fit too much information on one slide.  Slides with more than 25 words are usually too wordy.  Either condense your text, replace it with an image, or add a new slide: they're free!

Pick a single, readable font (Verdana and Arial are good choices, and I personally favor Gill Sans) and use it throughout the presentation.  If you want to emphasize something, make the font bold and/or red.

When you mention a published research finding, put the citation at the bottom of the slide in smaller font.   You don’t have to say it aloud or have a references slide, but this allows anyone who's interested to look it up.

Include a slide at the end with a summary of your argument, and say "Thank you.  Any questions?" to let your audience know when you are finished.

### Practicing your presentation

Always practice your presentation ahead of time.  It makes an enormous difference.  Ask a friend to watch you practice to make sure that your presentation makes sense.

Practicing in front of a person is also a great way to <i>learn how long the talk takes</i> and to catch any errors.  I can tell when my students haven't done this.

Know the material well enough that you can look up from your notes.

If you can, test the presentation on the computer that you will use (or at least one with the operating system, Mac or PC, that you will use) to be sure that the images show up and any links work.

If you are a Mac user and you are using your own laptop, be sure that you have the right dongle to connect your computer to the projector.  Different models have different ones, so it's not enough to just borrow one from a friend who also has a Mac, unless you are sure she has the same one.

### Giving your presentation

#### Dress for success

Start by showering and doing what you need to do to your hair to look presentable (no prom updoes necessary).  Consider shaving facial stubble.

You don't need to wear a suit for a class presentation (at least in my class), but business casual is usually a good call: dress pants or a knee-length skirt, with a nice shirt.

Avoid clothing that will distract you or your audience. If you can see cleavage or if you catch yourself tugging at your pants to keep them up, change clothes before you leave home.

If you tuck in your shirt, wear a belt.

Do not wear a baseball cap!  Your audience needs to see your eyes.

#### Once you're in class

Smile. Make eye contact with your audience.  Remember that they want you to succeed; no one enjoys sitting through a bad presentation.

Pause after you say something important or counterintuitive, to give the audience time to think about what you just said.  Rephrase or repeat it, if necessary.

Start strong and finish strong.  A weak presentation begins "So, um, I'm going to talk about..." and ends with "Uh, I guess that's it."  A good presentation begins "Today, I'd like to talk to you about..." and ends with a final "Thank you."
